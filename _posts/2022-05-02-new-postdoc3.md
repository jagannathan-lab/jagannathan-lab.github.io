Super excited to welcome <a href="/docs/li-cv.pdf">Zhongyou Li</a> to the lab as a new postdoctoral fellow. Zhongyou comes to us from [Bruce Stanton's](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=193) lab at Darmouth College. Zhongyou's thesis work focused on understanding the anti-inflammatory effect of tRNA fragments in Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles induced by tobramycin. In our lab, he will investigate mechanisms of NMD suppression.
