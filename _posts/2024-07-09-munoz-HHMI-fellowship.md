We are so thrilled for Oscar to have been named a [HHMI Gilliam fellow](https://www.hhmi.org/news/hhmi-names-50-gilliam-fellows-milestone-year?utm_campaign=gilliam-fellows&utm_source=outlook&utm_medium=email&utm_content=jh+gilliam&utm_term=2024). This fellowship will support Oscar's thesis work on understanding long UTR-mediated NMD as well as our joint efforts to improve student wellness on our campus. 

We are grateful to HHMI for the support!
