Divya was the first graduate student to join the lab when we opened doors in 2018. It is bittersweet to say goodbye after all these years, knowing she is off to do bigger and better things, though we will miss her still. She is headed to the Bay Area to work for Gilead Sciences, where we know she will do amazing things!

We had a farewell celebration at the Stanley Marketplace and shared some gifts that we hope will remind her of Colorado and all the good times we had as a lab!
