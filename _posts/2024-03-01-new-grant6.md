Suja has received an [NSF CAREER](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2338218&HistoricalAwards=false) award to fund the lab's work on NMD, specifically asking how physiological RNAs that resemble aberrant RNAs to escape quality control, as well as our outreach work with the Aurora Science and Tech Middle and High school. We are so grateful for this support and recognition from NSF! <br>
