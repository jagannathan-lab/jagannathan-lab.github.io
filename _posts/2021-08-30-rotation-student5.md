<a href="/docs/martin-cv.pdf">Gemma (Gem) Martin</a> is a first year [BSP](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/biomedical-sciences-program/home) student. Gem has bravely taken on a project to enrich for and sequence DUX4 transcript isoforms from FSHD and unaffected myotubes understand which isoforms contribute to FSHD pathogenesis. We are so excited to have them in the lab!
