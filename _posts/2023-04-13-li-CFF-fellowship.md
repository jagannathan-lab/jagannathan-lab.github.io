Zhongyou Li, a postdoc in the lab, has been awarded a [Path to a Cure Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.cff.org/researchers/path-cure-academic-programs#award-types) by the [Cystic Fibrosis Foundation](https://www.heart.org/) to support his work on the role of NMD in CF, and ways to modulate NMD efficiency. Congrats, Zhongyou!! 

We celebrated with cake and champagne, of course. 

So grateful to CFF for the support and recognition of Zhongyou!
