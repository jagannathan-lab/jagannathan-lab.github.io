Oscar and Mlana, our two newest grad students, have both received [T32 awards](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-biology/t32-awardees) from the Molecular Biology Program at CU Anschutz. Congrats, Oscar and Mlana!! 

We had a very belated celebration with Em's icecream and champagne. 

Many thanks to MOLB for the support!
