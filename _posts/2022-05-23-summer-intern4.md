<a href="/docs/bozik-cv.pdf">Jack Bozik</a> is a rising Senior at Bellarmine University in Louisville, KY. He is a Gates summer intern in the lab this summer and will be working with Dr. Amy Campbell on understanding the mechanisms underlying DUX4 toxicity in FSHD. We are excited to have Jack with us this summer!
