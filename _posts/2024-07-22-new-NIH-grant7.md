Our lab has been awarded an R01 from [NIAMS](https://www.niams.nih.gov/) to fund our work on FSHD. Over the coming years, we will be investigating the mechanisms of DUX4-induced misregulation of RNA processing and quality control. I am so excited for all the work that this will grant will enable. 

At this point, I want to specifically thank the wonderful patient advocacy organizations, [Friends of FSH](https://www.fshfriends.org/), the [Chris Carrino Foundation for FSHD](https://chriscarrinofoundation.org/), and the [FSHD Society](https://www.fshdsociety.org/), for supporting our work in this area with several pilot awards as we worked towards securing fedaral funding. We could not have sustained our FSHD research efforts without their early support! <br>
