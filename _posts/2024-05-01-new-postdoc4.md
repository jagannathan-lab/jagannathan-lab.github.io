We are delighted to have <a href="/docs/pragyan-cv.pdf">Pragyan Singh</a> join the lab as a new postdoctoral fellow. Pragyan brings a strong background in yeast genetics and nuclear RNA surveillance from her PhD and postdoctoral work. In our lab, she will study RNA misprocessing in the human muscle disease, FSHD.
