Today, we said farewell to Cameron, who started as an undergrad summer intern two years ago, and contributed to many different projects over the last two years. 

Cameron is headed to Washington University at St. Louis to start his PhD. We celebrated with lunch at Ambli Mexico and gifts that will hopefully come in handy during grad school, along with the now-lab-tradition: hand-decorated lab coat. So excited for all that his future holds!!
