Zhongyou Li, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab, will be moving back to Taiwan to start a new career as an R&D Manager at Taiwan Bio. It has been a wonderful 3 years of having him in the lab, and he will be sorely missed. 

We had a farewell celebration at T-street and shared some gifts that we hope will induce him to come back and visit the US/Colorado (and thus, the lab)!
