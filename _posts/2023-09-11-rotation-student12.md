<a href="/docs/deshpande-cv.pdf">Abhishek Deshpande</a> is a first year [MOLB](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-biology/home) graduate student. Abhishek will be exploring various pipelines for reclassification of variants of uncertain significance during his rotation in collaboration with Dr. Shawn McCandless. We are excited to have him in the lab!
