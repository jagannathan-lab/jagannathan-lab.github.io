<a href="/docs/poterewicz-cv.pdf">Gabriela Padilla</a>, a first year [MOLB](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/molecular-biology/home) graduate student, will be joining the lab for his 2nd rotation. Greg will be investigating mechanisms of feedback between NMD and transcription/splicing. We are excited to have him in the lab!
