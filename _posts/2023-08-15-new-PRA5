We are excited to welcome <a href="/docs/mcentee-cv.pdf">Kelly McEntee</a> to our lab as a Professional Research Assistant. Kelly graduated from CU Boulder this summer with a BA in Biochemistry and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. Kelly will be a joint PRA in the Jagannathan and [Hesselberth](https://hesselberthlab.org/), laboratories exploring ASO-based RNA therapeutics for genetic diseases.
